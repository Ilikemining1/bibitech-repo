        <p>iDroid 11.02 codenamed "Pepparkaka" is now available through Bootlace. This realease brings Android up to version 2.3.2 codenamed "Gingerbread". First you'll notice the new versioning scheme. We have moved to a Ubuntu style versioning scheme that is based on the year and month of release. We felt this was a better choice as iDroid is not currently at a stable or near stable state. As such we will be using this versioning until such a point that we deem it stable to revert to 1.x.x versioning schemes.</p><br />
        <p>Next you'll notice the upgrade to Google's hyped "Gingerbread" release, Android 2.3. This brings a slew of improvements to the operating system and are detailed <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.3-highlights.html">here</a>.</p><br />
        <p>User data may be lost in upgrade so backup anything you need. Other changes include an improved soft-buttons implementation, a new boot animation and a variety of bug fixes. Unfortunately due to the move to 2.3 the accelerometer is temporarily broken awaiting a rewrite of libsensors. See <a href="http://www.idroidproject.org/forum/announcements/idroid-mojo-1-0-5-release-announcement/">this post</a> for more details on changes.</p><br />
        <p>Bootlace has also been update to 2.1.6 to fix issues users are experiencing with the new 4.2 version of PwnageTool. Compatability should be restored now.</p>
