        <p>Donations to the iDroid Project help us acquire more devices to port OpeniBoot and iDroid. They also help fund our hosting costs, certificates for signing drivers and tools used for porting. If you would like to see development continue and motivate the developers behind the project, please consider donating to one of the developers below.</p><br />
        <p>So far we have managed to acquire an iPhone 3GS for our developer Ricky to allow him to start the porting process as soon as it arrives.</p><br />
        <p><center><form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post"><input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick"><input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="MY6RRGS299A6C"><input type="image" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online."></form></center></p><br />
        <span class="header">Bluerise</span>
        <p><b>iPod Touch 4G</b> - None of the team posess an iPod Touch 4th Generation. As such Bluerise is willing to port OpeniBoot to the device if enough donations are raised. This will also aid iPhone 4 and iPad porting due to the A4 chip inside.</p><br />

        <p><b>Hosting & General donations</b> - use the PayPal link at the top to make donations for no particular project or to help support us with the hosting costs.</p><br />

        <p><b>ARM Decompiler Software</b> - with an ARM decompiler the process of debugging OpeniBoot and thus porting can be greatly sped up. However this is specialised software with an expensive licence. This will benefit the whole team and all devices.</p><br />

        <p><b>Apple TV 2G</b> - we'd like more A4 based devices to work on porting to. The cheapest of these is the new Apple TV and will be helpful for the iPhone 4, iPod Touch 4G and iPad as they are all based on the A4. Plus why not unlock this cheap and discrete box to play what you want with XBMC or similar?</p><br />
